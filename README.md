# React.js Coding Test

For a senior-level React.js coding test, we aim to assess real-world problem-
solving skills, code quality, and scalability.


## Project core logic

The tech stack will be based on React.js. You are free to use other packages as you
like, but I recommend including state management, form validation, and a good UX
experience. The project can be improved based on your ideas, and you can add
additional features. The core logic is as mentioned.

- Pick a location on the map, and its latitude & longitude will be filled in the form.

- Submit a form with location details (name, description, image, latitude, longitude).

- Display submitted locations on the map as markers.

- Have a separate list page that shows submitted locations

- Allow viewing and editing of locations from the list.


## Recommendation

- Marker dragging
- Zod/Yup for validation
- React Hook Form
- Global state management (Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Context API)
- Marker opens a pop-up with location details
- Lazy loading
- Authentication (Bonus)
- Backend integration (Bonus)



When you complete the code test, please create a pull request to the main branch. We will review it. Thanks!
